* Introduction
This project is based on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE][Sebastian Lague's "Coding Adventure"]] video.

The video documents his investigation into fluid dynamics, and his following implementation in Unity using C#.

This project has been developed using C++ and Raylib for basic graphical interfacing
